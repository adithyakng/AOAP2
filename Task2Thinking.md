The algorithm uses a nested loop to iterate over each element in the matrix and 
considers it as the top-left corner of a square. For each such element, it iterates over all
the elements to the right and below it to check if the square can be extended. 
Since the algorithm visits each element in the matrix exactly once, the time complexity is O(m * n).

In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm must visit each element in the matrix for each element, 
resulting in O(m^2 * n^2) time complexity.
